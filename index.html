                        intuitive user interface. The app plays nicely with Communicator LITE on Barco’s DP2K-10S projector
                        and with media servers featuring a web-based user interface. CineMate automatically detects Barco

                        a web user interface into the dashboard. In this way, the app allows you to group and structure your
                        digital cinema equipment in a clear overview that enables faster operation.
